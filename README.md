# poopenfarten
A Collection of single header libs for C written just for fun.  
I made it in a hurry and no safety guarantees 😉   
I named it poopenfarten (or pf for short) because my code quality is poop. (poopenfarten means poop fart in english)   

**Story:**   
I am making a game, I need simple stuff that isn't available by default in c.   
Instead of using others' implementation, why not mine???   
Peak of Mount stupid I know!!! 🔥🔥🔥
