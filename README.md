A Collection of single header code for C written just for fun.  
I made it in blazing speeds and no safety guarantees 😉   
Deal with it   

**Story:**   
I am making a game, I need simple stuff that isn't available by default in c.   
Instead of using others' implementation, why not mine???   
Peak of Mount stupid I know!!! 🔥🔥🔥
